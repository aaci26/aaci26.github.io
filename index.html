  <meta name="description" content="I am a fourth year Psychology major seeking to become a Marriage and Family Therapist in the near future. I have a passion for working with kids, in which I hope to continue to do so in my line of work. Along with this, I do have a background in marketing and entrepreneurship. However, within the cooperate world, I have always worked retail. With working in retail I was able to adapt the skills of customer service, team-work, organizational skills, emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, etc. These skills also became very important to me as a person who previously had small businesses of my own as a young adult. I hope to gain more insight and knowledge corresponding to my career path and interest with working with children, youth, and families.">

        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a 21 year old first generation Nigerian-Bajan American Scholar majoring in Psychology. From a young age, I have always been imersered in the Arts. It was a way for me to navigate my mental health but also incorparate my creativity. It was my healthy form of dealing with the trials and tribulations I was going through. Therefore I started exploring all aspects of art; from fashion, sewing, painting, drawing, murals, dance, etc. I dipped my feet in anything you would define as arts rather than resorting to negative coping mechanisms. Dance became my ultimate coping mechanism, which then turned into a life-long passion. It was my source of expressign my mental state when the world, family and “friends” silenced me. However this also made me realize I wanted others to feel the same way I did when I found a way to feel heard and seen. I wanted to be an advocate for others to speak on their mental health but also find halthy ways to navigate through it. 
<br><br>

       Inspired by these experiences, I am firmly committed to becoming a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, with a focus on serving youth and young adults. These are two groups whose mental health concerns are often misunderstood or minimized. As a fourth-year Psychology major at the University of California, Riverside, I have already gained practical skills working both within academic settings and in the broader community. My passion for working with children manifested not only through research, advocacy, and volunteer work, but also in my active role as President of the Black Psych Society at UCR. In this leadership position, I strive to create spaces where underrepresented voices are amplified, and I regularly organize events that center on mental health, generational trauma, and professional development. Complementing my academic focus, I have experience in both marketing and entrepreneurship. Owning and running small businesses in my youth taught me the value of initiative, adaptability, and creative problem-solving. My time in retail, meanwhile, sharpened my abilities in customer service, teamwork, conflict resolution, and emotional intelligence. These skills are now just as vital in my professional psychology pursuits as they once were behind a counter.
<br><br>

        Looking ahead, my goal is to continue developing as both a clinician and an advocate. I want to blend my love for the arts, my dedication to social justice, and my understanding of cultural nuances into a practice that lifts up communities often left behind in traditional mental health models. I am excited to keep learning and growing alongside peers and mentors who share my commitment to holistic and inclusive care for children, youth, and families. Through every step, I remain grateful for the journey thus far and hopeful for the impact I can have as I move forward. My goal is to help others to be seen, heard, and empowered, just as I once sought for myself.​ I am looking forward to the things I will continue to learn along the way of my journey till I finally get there.
